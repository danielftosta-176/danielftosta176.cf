            <p>We are going to shut down temporarily.</p>

            <p>There are currently multiple vulnerabilities in the old roblox clients that we can not fix at the moment, such as the IP grabbing situation that is currently happening which has affected possibly around ~200 people who have joined infected games in the past week or so. Due to this, and much other needed fixes that are needed to keep GoodBlox stable, as well as staff needing to have a break, we feel that it is in the best interest of the users and staff that we keep GoodBlox offline for an indefinite period as we get things back together (properly).</p>

            <p>Once GoodBlox comes back, the website and client will be at the standards that they should have been uphold at. With that being said, there is no telling when it could come back. It could be a month, 6 months, a year, or if decisions change, it might end up just closing permanently.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all of your time here.</p>
